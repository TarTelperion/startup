# Elevator Pitch

Have you *ever* felt abandoned by your muse? Like all of a sudden, ***all*** of your inspiration was drained from your head, and bottled, used by some unseen writer simply for amusement? Have you ever wished  you could just pound out *part* of a story, and have the rest finished for you? 

...well.

I may have a solution for you.

In Writer's Block, you can join with a group of friends to co-author a story. Set your word goal, your goal for words per session, and then choose your friends. Then you're set! Writer's Block will generate a set of five random words as your prompt, and then the first author will be randomly selected to write. When they hit their goal, the next person will be notified. They can read the most recent set of writing, and add theirs. And the torch is passed.

Choose your adventure,
choose your story.
