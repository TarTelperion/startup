            Writers Block is a speculative writing website for idea generation and for writers of similar minds to congregate. Make an account to begin, and generate a prompt.
            After the generation of a prompt, one person in your group will be selected to start writing. When they hit a predetermined word count, the second person in the chain will
            read the most recent content, and then write their section of the story. <br>
            This will continue until either a prechosen word count is hit, or until all members vote to end the chain. <br>
            Afterwards the entire story will be open for all to read. <br>
            Either start your own story, or make one with friends, or even join a trending one anonymously, your worlds are at your fingertips.
