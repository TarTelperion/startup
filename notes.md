Git documentation:
	- `git add` adds a fresh file to your staging area
	- `git commit` commits the file to your git tree *on device*
	- `git push` will push those changes to the git tree online in github
	- `git pull` pulls the most recent changes to your computer
	- when doing a git commit and push, if you get a merge error, you use `vi` or some other interface to manually resolve the problem
	- `git branch` will show your branch status
	- `git branch <name>` creates a branch
	- `git checkout` moves you to a different branch
	- `git merge <name>` merges the named branch with your current branch
