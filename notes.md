CS260 notes:

Git documentation:
	- `git add` adds a fresh file to your staging area
	- `git commit` commits the file to your git tree *on device*
	- `git push` will push those changes to the git tree online in github
	- `git pull` pulls the most recent changes to your computer
	- when doing a git commit and push, if you get a merge error, you use `vi` or some other interface to manually resolve the problem
	- `git branch` will show your branch status
	- `git branch <name>` creates a branch
	- `git checkout` moves you to a different branch
	- `git merge <name>` merges the named branch with your current branch
Different languages:
	- HTML is structure (building the bones)
	- CSS style, (Add some meat to that)
	- JavaScript is interaction, (Add ligaments, nerves, muscles)
	- Service - web service endpoints (Add a personality, give it existence, make it real)
	- Database/Login - persisted app and auth data (Mongo, this is memory)
	- WebSocket - Data pushed from server, chat, notifications! Chat! This is really important for my startup! (Language)
	- React - Web framework, modern design to wrap components and make them easier (I can't find a body analogy for this...)
 AWS:
 	- AWS is a webservice hosted by amazon that can run websites, you host them on a service
  	- Route 58 allows you to connect a name from DNS to your IP address
