**CS260 notes:**

**Git documentation**:
- `git add` adds a fresh file to your staging area
- `git commit` commits the file to your git tree *on device*
- `git push` will push those changes to the git tree online in github
- `git pull` pulls the most recent changes to your computer
- when doing a git commit and push, if you get a merge error, you use `vi` or some other interface to manually resolve the problem
- `git branch` will show your branch status
- `git branch <name>` creates a branch
- `git checkout` moves you to a different branch
- `git merge <name>` merges the named branch with your current branch
**Different languages:**
- HTML is structure (building the bones)
- CSS style, (Add some meat to that)
- JavaScript is interaction, (Add ligaments, nerves, muscles)
- Service - web service endpoints (Add a personality, give it existence, make it real)
- Database/Login - persisted app and auth data (Mongo, this is memory)
- WebSocket - Data pushed from server, chat, notifications! Chat! This is really important for my startup! (Language)
- React - Web framework, modern design to wrap components and make them easier (I can't find a body analogy for this...)
**AWS:**
- AWS is a webservice hosted by amazon that can run websites, you host them on a service
- Route 58 allows you to connect a name from DNS to your IP address
**CSS:**
- a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
- The main difference between Inline, external and internal CSS Styles is their location and scope of application. Inline CSS styles are included within the HTML document and are specific to individual HTML elements, allowing for targeted styling. Internal CSS styles are included within the head section of an HTML document and apply to the entire document, allowing for consistent styling across multiple elements. External CSS styles are stored in a separate file and can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for global styling across an entire website.
